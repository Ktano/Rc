CATS ARE VERY POPULAR PETS AND THERE ARE MANY DIFFERENT BREEDS THAT ALL VARY IN SIZE, COLOUR AND MARKINGS. AN AVERAGE CAT REACHES A LENGTH OF 50-60 CM AND WEIGHS ABOUT 3-5 KG. THE FUR MAY BE BLACK, WHITE, BROWN, GREY, RED, BLACK AND WHITE, TABBY (STRIPED) OR CALICO.

CATS ARE VERY GOOD HUNTERS AND USE THEIR STRONG, SHARP CLAWS AND TEETH TO GRAB AND HOLD THEIR PREY. IN THE WILD, CATS FEED ON MICE, BIRDS AND OTHER SMALL ANIMALS.
SENSES

CATS SEE AND HEAR EXTREMELY WELL. THEY CAN SEE IN THE DARK AND HEAR MANY SOUNDS THAT HUMANS ARE NOT ABLE TO HEAR. TO FEEL THEIR WAY ROUND, CATS USE THEIR WHISKERS.
CAT LANGUAGE

CATS SAY 'MEOW'. IF THEY FEEL VERY COMFORTABLE, THEY PURR. IF A CAT IS ANGRY, IT WAGS ITS TAIL, LOWERS ITS EARS, AND HISSES OR GROWLS. JUST WATCH YOUR CAT: EYES, EARS, TAIL AND BODY POSTURE TELL YOU A LOT ABOUT HOW YOUR CAT FEELS.
